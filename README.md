ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Brian!
**QA Engineer | Software Tester | Healthcare Tech Advocate**

I am a results-oriented Quality Assurance Engineer with proven experience leading QA teams, designing comprehensive test strategies, and building robust automated testing frameworks using tools like Cypress and Postman.

My background spans both health tech and energy sectors, where Iâ€™ve successfully applied manual and automated testing, API validation, bug lifecycle management, and CI/CD pipeline integration to ensure high-quality product delivery. I specialize in driving process improvements, creating clear Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and working closely with cross-functional teams in fast-paced Agile environments.

Iâ€™m passionate about delivering clean, reliable software and thrive in dynamic spaces where quality makes the difference.
